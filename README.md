<h1>Hetio-net</h1>
This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that I created for my database class that connects to a Neo4j database to fetch disease-related data from HetioNet. It allows users to:
<li>Get detailed information about a selected disease, such as associated genes, drugs, and anatomical locations. </li>
<li>Find potential new treatments for a given disease based on gene regulation.</li>
